# Foundation

## TL;DR

Foundation is my core library, or framework, for C programs.

## What is «Foundation»

«Foundation» is a wondrous word. A library named after the idea of «foundational framework» should be a great one.
It should support dozens upon dozens of future applications; providing helpful and bug-free code.
It should be well integrated with the target language (C in our case) and provide a rich collection of
reusable components.
